Pewlett-Hackard Analysis – The Silver Tsunami 

Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to analyze the employee and retiree status of the large company “Pewlett-Hackard”, by constructing database queries and building tables from a number of data sources.  The analysis is determine the number of skilled and trained employees that will be retiring, and how large of an impact their departure will have on the company’s workforce.

General Analysis and take-aways

By looking at the data, we can see that a large number of employees are reaching retirement age.  The two job titles with highest number of retiring workers are: Senior Engineers and Senor Staff.  These titles signify long tenure, and leadership level roles.  When the people in these positions retire, the workforce will lose a lot of the knowledge keepers and subject matter experts.  Industries will face difficulty in maintaining their level of performance if this “silver tsunami” of retirements occur, without proper documentation of roles and job instructions.  Part of our analysis is to determine  how many skilled employees are not immediately retiring, but tenured enough to train and assist with new hires.

The table below tells us that:
•	There are 72458 unique roles filled by employees which are retirement ready.
•	50842 retirement-ready employees hold senior-level job titles.
•	Over 70% of the soon-to-be-retires hold senior-level job titles.
•	With the departure of well over half of the senior-level employees, the company will lose a lot of knowledge and expertise, unless something is done to train in new hires before the subject-matter-experts retire.

Mentorship Analysis

The best way for Pewlett-Hackard to get through this wave of retirements, is to set up mentorship programs for the younger population who will eventually be taking on these upper level positions.  From the query we ran to find eligible mentors, with the constraint on birthdates from the year 1965, the number of eligible mentors near retirement was only 1549 people.  It is a good chunk, but not a lot relative to the size of the company.  If we re-define our query to a 3-year timespan for birthday years between 1964 and 1966, the results are much more telling.  This query example shows us that there are 19905 eligible mentors, which are close to retirement but still employed.  This is a much more useful query, as the number of eligible mentors does not need to be confined to a single birth-year.  Realistically, potential mentors will fall under a range of years.  This gives us hope for the future generation of workers, knowing that there is a decent sized pool to work with.

Summary

Initiating a mentorship program for the new generation of high level job roles will be an excellent way to help combat the large wave of retirement.  It will be hard work, and there may be more retirees than potential mentors, but given the inevitability of  the “silver tsunami”, mentorship programs will an effective way to assist with the growing pains of the company.  Pewlett-Hackard should start hiring employees immediately, and pair them with mentors as soon as they start their roles.  If this mentorship initiative is not introduced, the company will have major issues keeping up with their past performance levels.
